## 1. Project Overview
### 1.1 Project Description
EarthAngel is an app designed to help people recycle used items. It provides a platform where owners of idle items can publish them, and those in need can contact the owners to get the items for free.

The main feature of EarthAngel is that it is free. In a consumer-driven society, people often choose to sell their unused items to make some extra income. However, for some in need, these items may be necessary but they cannot afford to pay for them. EarthAngel provides the perfect platform for these people to get the items they need for free.

EarthAngel is not only beneficial to the environment but also to the community. By recycling unused items, we can reduce waste, alleviate the burden on landfills, and provide these items to those in need. This not only helps them solve some problems but also enhances the cohesion of the community.

If you have some idle items, you can consider publishing them on EarthAngel. You can help those who need these items through this platform, while also contributing to the environment and community. If you need some items, you can also find them on EarthAngel. This is a community of mutual assistance where we can contribute together to the environment and community.

### 1.2 Project Features
- Environmental Concept: EarthAngel is an app dedicated to environmental protection. By recycling used items, it reduces resource waste and also alleviates the burden on landfills. This not only helps protect the environment but also makes a contribution to the future world.

- Free Service: The service provided by EarthAngel is completely free, aimed at helping those in need to get the items they need. For the owners of the items, this is also good news because they can give their unused items to those who need them for free.

- Community Connection: EarthAngel is not only an app for recycling used items, but also helps people in the community connect. Through this platform, people can help and support each other in the community, building a loving community relationship.
