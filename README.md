# EarthAngel Project Introduction
English|[中文版](https://github.com/engineerrep/EarthAngel/blob/main/README_CN.md)

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Description

EarthAngel is an App dedicated to recycling unused items, with the aim of providing a platform for individuals to post their unused items for others to obtain for free.

EarthAngel's main feature is that it is completely free. In today's consumer-driven society, individuals often turn to selling their unused items to generate additional income. However, for those in need, these items may be essential, but they cannot afford them. EarthAngel provides the perfect platform for people to obtain the items they need for free.

EarthAngel also benefits the environment. By recycling unused items, we can reduce waste, decrease the burden on landfills, and provide these items to those in need. This not only helps them solve problems, but also protects the environment.

Consider posting your unused items on EarthAngel to help those in need and make a contribution to the environment. And if you are in need of items, you can also search for them on EarthAngel.

### 1.2 Project Features

- Environmental concept: EarthAngel is committed to environmental conservation by recycling unused items, reducing waste and the burden on landfills. This not only protects the environment but also contributes to the future.

- Free services: EarthAngel's services are completely free, aimed at helping people in need obtain the items they require. For the item owners, this is also a good thing, as they can provide unused items for free to those who need them.

- Establishing connections and support: EarthAngel is an application for recycling unused items, which not only helps individuals find the items they need but also establishes connections and mutual support.
