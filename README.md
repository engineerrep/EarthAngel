# EarthAngel Project Description
[English](https://github.com/engineerrep/EarthAngel/blob/main/README.md) | Chinese Version

## 1. Project Overview
### 1.1 Project Summary
EarthAngel is an app designed to help people recycle second-hand items. It provides a platform for owners of unused items to post them on it and for people in need to contact the owners to obtain the items free of charge.

The main feature of EarthAngel is its provision of free services. In today's consumption-based society, people often choose to sell unused items to earn extra income. However, these items might be what some people in need require, but they cannot afford the cost of purchasing them. EarthAngel provides a perfect platform for these people to obtain the items they need for free.

EarthAngel is not only beneficial to the environment but also to the community. By recycling unused items, we can reduce waste, ease the burden of landfills, and give these items to those who need them. This not only helps to solve some of their problems but also enhances community cohesion.

If you have any unused items, consider posting them on EarthAngel. Through this platform, you can help people in need of these items and make contributions to the environment and community. If you need some items, you can also find them on EarthAngel. This is a community where we can help each other and make contributions to the environment and community together.

### 1.2 Project Features
